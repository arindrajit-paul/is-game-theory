# Estimating the Probability of Heads for a Biased Coin

## Objective

To determine the best strategy that results in the highest score over a set number of iterations.

## Variables

We vary the payoff structure (or the scoring rule) and test player strategies using examples from classical game theory. The number of rounds per simulation is $1,000$, and there are $20$ simulations.
